In the Godot Editor:

Add a MeshInstance3D node to your scene
In the Inspector, set the Mesh property (choose BoxMesh, SphereMesh, CapsuleMesh, etc.)
At the top of the viewport, click the Mesh menu button
Choose one of these options:

Create Trimesh Static Body - for static objects like walls/floors
Create Convex Static Body - simpler collision shape
Create Trimesh Collision Sibling - adds collision as a sibling node
Create Convex Collision Sibling - convex version as sibling

This automatically creates the StaticBody3D and CollisionShape3D nodes as children of your mesh.


For custom models imported from Blender/other software:

Same process, but make sure your mesh is already assigned
Trimesh collision works best for complex static geometry
Convex collision is better for objects that need to move

That's it! The collision will match your mesh shape automatically.
